# PySPuDS

PySPuDS is a python wrapper to [Structure Prediction and Diagnostic Software (SPuDS)](https://www.unf.edu/~michael.lufaso/spuds/) enabling high-throughput perovskite (Glazer tilt) structure predictions.

Currently PySPuDS only supports ABX<sub>3</sub> structure generation (SPuDS menu item 1). 
Future support for SPuDS menu items 3, 6, and 7 is planned.
